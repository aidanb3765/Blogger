After reading the paper by Gartner on the disruptive capabilites of microservices when it comes to the current foundations and protocols that are used for the application development, deployment, and percision. The MSA, microservices architecture, is the implementation model for building services that are independentally and capable of using front-end user interfaces (apps) with the back-end components (services) in a smooth way. The model creates an environment that is different from the norm, changing the ways we enable development teams to improve and change components within an application. The different types of implementations found were microservice, miniservice, and macroservice, allowing for a company or corporation that use this MSA model to make use of various combinations of different levels of granuity. While reading the information on these and seeing the different figures used to give examples of the different levels, I at first thought why doesn't everyone make use of this model. This thought was changed as I read about the challenges that organization have for adopting these changes. Microservice adoption is diruptive to the way organizations have their data managed with regard to reporting or analytics, teams having autonomy and authority to make these builds, new and complex applications making use of DevOps practices, and so much more. These companies who try and adopt MSA find that they aren't ready and start to lose costs because of these huge changes in their applications or changes in implemetning these domain level functionalities, or possibly the communication between the various users. The MSA is a great model for changing and creating an agile application, but if you aren't ready to keep up then change your application in other ways. Although other ways may not be as scalable (capability to change in size or scale) as the MSA, they can still be as agile. You are changing how your organization is run in the digital world, but when you are just starting out from scratch it could be beneficial to, just figure what works for you and update.
